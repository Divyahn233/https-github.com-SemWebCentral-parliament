# Parliament

Parliament™ is a high-performance triple store and reasoner designed for the [Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/).  Parliament's initial development was funded by the DARPA through the DAML program under the name [DAML DB](http://www.daml.org/2001/09/damldb/) and was extended by Raytheon BBN Technologies (BBN) for internal use in its R&D programs.  BBN released Parliament as an open source project under the [BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) on [SemWebCentral](http://parliament.semwebcentral.org/) in 2009.  In 2018, BBN migrated the Parliament open source project to [GitHub](https://github.com/SemWebCentral/parliament) under the same license.

Parliament™ is a trademark of Raytheon BBN Technologies.  It is so named because a group of owls is properly called a _parliament_ of owls.
