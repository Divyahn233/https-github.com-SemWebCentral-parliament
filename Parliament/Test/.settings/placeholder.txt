keeping Eclipse's language.settings.xml file (located in this directory)
under source control is a problem.  However, deleting and ignoring the
directory in git would cause any other file that Eclipse wanted to add
to that directory to be ignored as well.  This file exists to keep the
.settings directory under source control, even though the only file in
that directory (language.settings.xml) is not.
